# Release 0.13.0

### Improvements

* Added support for iSWAP and CPhase gate operations.
  [(#45)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/45)

### Bug fixes

* Removed import of `qsimcirq` from `__init__.py`, allowing other devices in
  this plugin to work without `qsimcirq` being installed.

# Release 0.12.1

### New features since last release

* PennyLane integration with the [qsim circuit simulator
  package](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim) is now available.
  [(#36)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/36).

  The new devices include:

  * `cirq.qsim`, a Schrödinger full state-vector simulator

  * `cirq.qsimh`, a hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman simulator. This simulator cuts the qubit lattice into
    two parts; each part is individually simulated using qsim, with Feynman-style path summation used
    to return the final result. Compared to full state-vector simulation, qsimh reduces memory
    requirements, at the expense of an increased runtime.

  After installing the `qsimcirq` package, the qsim and qsimh devices
  can be invoked via the names `"cirq.qsim"` and `"cirq.qsimh"` respectively, e.g.,

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("cirq.qsimh", qsimh_options=qsimh_options, wires=3)
  ```

  These devices can then be used for the evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane. For more details,
  see the [PennyLane qsim
  documentation](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/qsim.html)

# Release 0.12.0

### New features since last release

* Devices from Cirq's Pasqal submodule are now available for use.
  [(#40)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/40).

  A simulator device compatible with Pasqal's neutral-atom model can be invoked via the name
  `"cirq.pasqal"`, e.g.,

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("cirq.pasqal", control_radius=1.0, wires=3)
  ```

# Release 0.11.0

### New features

* Made plugin device compatible with new PennyLane wire management.
  [(#37)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/37)
  [(#42)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/42)

  One can now specify any string or number as a custom wire label,
  and use these labels to address subsystems on the device:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('cirq.simulator', wires=['q1', 'ancilla', 0, 1])

  def circuit():
    qml.Hadamard(wires='q1')
    qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 'ancilla'])
    ...
  ```

# Release 0.8.0

### Improvements

* Ported the `CirqDevice` class to use the new `QubitDevice` base class,
  enabling the use of tensor observables.
  [#19](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/19)

* Added support for inverse operations by defining the `.inv()` method
  of the `CirqOperation` class which uses the `cirq.inverse` function.
  [#15](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/15)

### Bug fixes

* Replaced depreceated Cirq commands.
  [#19](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/19)

* Fix a minor bug introduced into the test suite by the release of Cirq 0.7.0.
  [#18](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/18)

* Fix bugs introduced into the test suite by the release of Cirq 0.6.0.
