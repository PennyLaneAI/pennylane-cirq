The PennyLane-Cirq plugin integrates the Cirq quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Cirq <https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq>`__ is a software library for quantum computing.

Installation
============

This plugin requires Python version 3.6 or above, as well as PennyLane
and Cirq. Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pennylane-cirq

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane-Cirq from the `source code <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-cirq>`__
by navigating to the top directory and running:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python setup.py install

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane-Cirq requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`__ >= 3.6

as well as the following Python packages:

* `PennyLane <http://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`__ >= 0.9
* `Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io/>`__ >= 0.7


If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend
`Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__, a distributed version of Python packaged
for scientific computation.


Tests
~~~~~

To test that the PennyLane-Cirq plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash
