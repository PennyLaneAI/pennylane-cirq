class PasqalDevice(SimulatorDevice):
    r"""Cirq Pasqal device for PennyLane.

    Args:
        wires (int): the number of wires to initialize the device with
        control_radius (float): The maximum distance between qubits for a controlled
                gate. Distance is measured in units of the ``ThreeDGridQubit`` indices.
        shots (int): Number of circuit evaluations/random samples used
            to estimate expectation values of observables. Shots need
            to be >= 1. If ``None``, expecation values are calculated analytically.
        qubits (List[cirq_pasqal.ThreeDGridQubit]): A list of Cirq ThreeDGridQubits that are used
            as wires. If not specified, the ThreeDGridQubits are put in a linear
            arrangement along the first coordinate axis, separated by a distance of
            ``control_radius / 2``.
            i.e., ``(0,0,0), (control_radius/2,0,0), (control_radius,0,0)``, etc.
