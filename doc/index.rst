PennyLane Cirq Plugin
#################################

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|


This PennyLane plugin allows the Cirq simulators/hardware to be used as PennyLane devices.


`Cirq <https://targetframework.readthedocs.io>`_ is a Python library for writing, manipulating,
and optimizing quantum circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a machine learning library for optimization
and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.



Features
========

* Access to Cirq's simulator backend via the `cirq.simulator` device

* Support for all PennyLane core functionality


To get started with the PennyLane Cirq plugin, follow the :ref:`installation steps <installation>`, then see the :ref:`usage <usage>` page.
