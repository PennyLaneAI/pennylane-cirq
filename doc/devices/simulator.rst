Simulator device
================

You can instantiate the device in PennyLane as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    dev = qml.device('cirq.simulator', wires=2)

This device can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane.
A simple quantum function that returns the expectation value of a measurement and depends on three classical input
parameters would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(x, y, z):
        qml.RZ(z, wires=[0])
        qml.RY(y, wires=[0])
        qml.RX(x, wires=[0])
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

You can then execute the circuit like any other function to get the quantum mechanical expectation value.

.. code-block:: python

    circuit(0.2, 0.1, 0.3)

Device options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cirq has different ways of defining qubits, e.g., ``LineQubit`` or ``GridQubit``. The Cirq device therefore accepts
an additional argument ``qubits=None`` that you can use to define your own
qubits and give them to the device as a list.

.. code-block:: python

    import cirq

    qubits = [
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 1),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 1),
    ]

    dev = qml.device("cirq.simulator", wires=4, qubits=qubits)

The wire of each qubit corresponds to its index in the ``qubit`` list. In the above example,
the wire 2 corresponds to ``cirq.GridQubit(1, 0)``.

If no qubits are given, the plugin will create an array of ``LineQubit`` instances.

Supported operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cirq.simulator`` device supports all PennyLane
`operations and observables <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html>`_.
