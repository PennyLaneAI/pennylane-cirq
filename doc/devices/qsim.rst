The qsim device
===============

The `qsim circuit simulator package <https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim>`__
provides two additional circuit simulators that can be used with PennyLane-Cirq:

* qsim, a Schrödinger full state-vector simulator

* qsimh, a hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman simulator. This simulator cuts the qubit lattice into two parts;
  each part is individually simulated using qsim, with Feynman-style path summation used to return the
  final result. Compared to full state-vector simulation, qsimh reduces memory requirements, at the expense
  of an increased runtime.

For further details see the `qsim website <https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim>`__.

For a large number of qubits, these simulators are considerably faster than the Cirq simulator:

    :width: 70%

In order to use these devices, the ``qsimcirq`` package must first be installed:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install qsimcirq

You can instantiate the qsim device in PennyLane as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    dev = qml.device('cirq.qsim', wires=2)

This device can then be used just like other devices for the evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane.
A simple quantum function that returns the expectation value of a measurement and depends on three classical input
parameters would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(x, y, z):
        qml.RZ(z, wires=[0])
        qml.RY(y, wires=[0])
        qml.RX(x, wires=[0])
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

You can then execute the circuit like any other function to get the quantum mechanical expectation value:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit(0.2, 0.1, 0.3)

The qsimh device can be loaded similarly, with the addition of the keyword
argument ``qsimh_options`` as described below.

Device options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

qsim and qsimh use the same method of defining qubits as Cirq, e.g., ``LineQubit``
or ``GridQubit``. As with the Cirq device, the qsim and qsimh devices therefore
accept an additional argument ``qubits`` that can be used to define your
own qubits and pass them to the device as a list.

.. code-block:: python

    import cirq

    qubits = [
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 1),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 1),
    ]

    dev = qml.device("cirq.qsim", wires=4, qubits=qubits)

The wire of each qubit corresponds to its index in the ``qubit`` list. In the above example,
the wire 2 corresponds to ``cirq.GridQubit(1, 0)``.

If no qubits are given, the plugin will create an array of ``LineQubit`` instances.

qsimh options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

qsimh requires specific options to be set for the simulator. These can be passed
by the positional argument ``qsimh_options``. See the `qsimh usage documentation
<https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/docs/usage.md>`__ for further
details.

.. code-block:: python

    import cirq

    qubits = [
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(0, 1),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 0),
      cirq.GridQubit(1, 1),
    ]

    qsimh_options = {
        'k': [0],
        'w': 0,
        'p': 0,
        'r': 2
    }

    dev = qml.device("cirq.qsimh", wires=4, qsimh_options=qsimh_options, qubits=qubits)

Supported operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cirq.qsim`` and ``cirq.qsimh`` devices support most PennyLane `operations
and observables
<https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html>`_,
with the exceptions of inverse operations and ``QubitUnitary`` gates on 3 or
more qubits.

For state preparation qsim relies on decomposing ``BasisState`` into a set of
`PauliX
<https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.PauliX.html>`__
gates and `QubitStateVector
<https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.QubitStateVector.html>`__
via `Möttönen state preparation
<https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.templates.state_preparations.MottonenStatePreparation.html>`__.
